I'm a Professor of Biology at the University of Southern Maine in Portland with a research program that has moved from geometric morphometrics to fish swimming biomechanics, to best practices in statistics for experimental bench biologists.

For recreation, I'm mostly a mountain runner but also XC skier, backcountry skier (mostly resort uphill), and gravel cyclist, and do most of these activities in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

The bike geometry project combines my interests in biological shape, biomechanics, biostatistics, and outdoor recreation.
