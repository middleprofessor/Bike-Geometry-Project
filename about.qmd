```{r echo = FALSE}
# I'm a Professor of Biology at the University of Southern Maine in Portland with a research program that has moved from geometric morphometrics to fish swimming biomechanics, to best practices in statistics for experimental bench biologists.
# 
# For recreation, I'm mostly a mountain runner but also XC skier, backcountry skier (mostly resort uphill), and gravel cyclist, and do most of these activities in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
# 
# The bike geometry project combines my interests in biological shape, biomechanics, biostatistics, and outdoor recreation.
