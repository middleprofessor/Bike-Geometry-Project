And now we have the Rambler. And so when I, things I like in gravel bikes. I believe that an endurance bike comfortable is fast.”\n– Jeff Frane, Gravel Ride Podcast"

    "text": "It’s common to read from company websites or from bike influencers on YouTube that gravel bikes come in two flavors: race and off-road. 2D scatter plots suggest three classes:\n\nRacy. Effectively, these have cyclocross bike geometry\nRelaxed. Compared to Racy: More upright, longer rearends, and longer trail – this is the direction of endurance road bikes compared to race road bikes.\nRowdy. Compared to Racy: Longer, slacker front ends, and steeper seat tubes – this is the direction of XC mountain bikes compared to road bikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClassification of gravel bikes is based on a frame size that fits a 176 cm (5’ 9.3”) high rider, according to manufacturer’s charts."
