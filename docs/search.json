    "text": "It’s common to read from company websites or from bike influencers on YouTube that gravel bikes come in two flavors: race and off-road. 2D scatter plots suggest three classes:\n\nRacy. Effectively, these have cyclocross bike geometry\nRelaxed. Compared to Racy: More upright, longer rearends, and longer trail – this is the direction of endurance road bikes compared to race road bikes.\nRowdy. Compared to Racy: Longer, slacker front ends, and steeper seat tubes – this is the direction of XC mountain bikes compared to road bikes.\n\n(Data shown are frame sizse that fit a 176 cm (5’ 9.3\") cm high rider, according to manufacturer’s charts)"
